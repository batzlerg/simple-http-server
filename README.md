# simple-static-server

As the name implies, this is a simple static server.

It can host basic web resources (html / css / js files) from a static directory and will eventually be somewhat configurable.


### Background

[I am a full-stack software engineer](https://grahammak.es) but my background is originally in frontend development. Because of this, I'm most familiar with NodeJS on the backend and I don't have too much Java experience.

I'm writing this as a side project to learn more about Java as a language and an ecosystem. Plus, before I get too cozy with a Java framework I want to be able to say I've done it from scratch!

###Tech

Maven
Java 9
